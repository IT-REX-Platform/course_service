# template-microservice
This serves as a template for the microservices

## Package structure

This package structure is based on multiple sources of best practices in Spring Boot, using roughly the "Package by layer" approach.
- *root*
  - *config*
  - *controller*
  - *dapr*
  - *dto*
  - *exception*
  - *persistence*
    - *dao*
    - *repository*
  - *service*

Detailed description of the packages:

### Root package

This should be named after the microservice itself. This is the root package for the microservice. It contains the `Application.java` file, which is the entry point for the microservice. Usually, this is the only class in this package.

### Config package
This package should contain any classes that are used to configure the application. This includes [Sprint Boot configuration classes](https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/context/annotation/Configuration.html) but might also contain anything else related to configuration the microservice.

### Controller package

This package contains the GraphQL controllers (and other types of controllers if needed). The GraphQL controllers are annotated with the `@Controller` annotation. Controllers contain no business logic, but only delegate the requests to the service layer. They handle the "technical stuff" of the request.

More information can be found in the [Controller package](src/main/java/de/unistuttgart/iste/gits/template/controller/package-info.java).

### Dapr package

This package should contain all classes that are used to communicate with Dapr, e.g. using pub sub.

### DTO package

**This package will not be located in the src/main/java folder, but in the build/generated folder.**

This package contains the generated DTOs (data transfer objects) from the GraphQL schema. The DTOs are generated when building the project with gradle. 

If not necessary, no other files should be added manually to this package.

#### Why both DTOs and Entities?

The DTOs are used to transfer data between the GraphQL controller and the service layer. The entities are used to persist data in the database. This is done to separate the data transfer from the data persistence. This is a common approach in Spring Boot applications as it can happen that we want to store more data in the database than we want to transfer to the client or vice versa.

### Exception package

This package is used for exception handling. Note that with GraphQL, the exceptions are not thrown directly, but are wrapped in a `GraphQLException`, which is different that from the usual Spring Boot approach.

More information can be found in the [Exception package](src/main/java/de/unistuttgart/iste/gits/template/exception/package-info.java).

### Persistence package

This package contains all classes that are used to persist data in the database. This includes the DAOs (data access objects) and the repositories.

More information can be found in the [Dao package](src/main/java/de/unistuttgart/iste/gits/template/persistence/dao/package-info.java) and the [Repository package](src/main/java/de/unistuttgart/iste/gits/template/persistence/repository/package-info.java).

### Service package

This package contains all classes that are used to handle the business logic of the microservice. Services are annotated with the `@Service` annotation. Services contain only business logic and delegate the data access to the persistence layer (repositories). 

More information can be found in the [Service package](src/main/java/de/unistuttgart/iste/gits/template/service/package-info.java).

## Getting Started

### Todos

After cloning the repository, you need to do the following steps:
- [ ] Setup the gradle files correctly. This means
  - [ ] Change the project name in the `settings.gradle` file
  - [ ] Change the package name in the `build.gradle` file (there is a TODO comment)
  - [ ] Add/Remove dependencies in the `build.gradle` file
- [ ] Rename the package in the `src/main/java` folder to the a more suitable name (should be the same as the package name in the `build.gradle` file)
- [ ] Remove the package-info.java files in the `src/main/java` folder (or update with the microservice specific information)
- [ ] Update the application.properties file in the `src/main/resources` folder (check the TODOS in the file)
- [ ] Define the GraphQL schema in the `src/main/resources/schema.graphqls` file
- [ ] Create a new database
<!-- TODO there probably more TODOs -->
