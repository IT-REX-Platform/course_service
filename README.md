# Course Service

The Course Service plays a pivotal role in the platform's educational ecosystem by serving as a comprehensive repository of essential course-related information. This information encompasses a wide array of details, including course names, comprehensive course descriptions, and the structural breakdown of courses into chapters and sections. This wealth of data is pivotal in guiding both educators and students through their learning journey within the platform.

One of the distinctive functions of the Course Service is its interaction with Keycloak, a robust identity and access management system. It leverages Keycloak to orchestrate the creation of course-level roles, subsequently assigning these roles to the respective users. This role assignment is instrumental in tailoring the user experience, granting access to specific course materials, assessments, and privileges in alignment with their course enrollment.

Behind the scenes, the Course Service is intricately connected to a persistent database. Within this database, course-specific information is meticulously stored, ensuring data consistency and availability throughout the platform. This persistent storage guarantees that course details remain intact and readily accessible, even across different sessions and interactions.
